# GenAI

This repo contains a chatbot for a summercamp called GenAI and is capable of answering questions about the camp's details,
as well as "registering" participants. Registration is currently textual only and does not actually store any information.

## Setup

Create a .env file with your OpenAI key stored under the value OPENAI_KEY.

## Running the Chatbot

Run the main.py file as a regualar python file and chat away. The system will share the camp details and the user can begin the conversation. The conversation is displayed in the terminal and the user is prompted for each message.
